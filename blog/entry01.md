# Deciding on What to do for Project and Tools
##### 11/3/2025

### Where I am at Now
For my SEP11 Freedom Project, I am working with a classmate, Brianna, in order to create a Spanish Learner Platform Game. Before choosing to work with a partner on this project, I had an idea to make a platformer game that involved answering a trivia and based on how many questions you get right from the trivia, the rewards you get from the correct answers would help you advance in the game. Thats when I noticed that Brianna had a similar idea, where her idea was to have an education platformer game where it helps you learn spanish. So, we decided to combine our ideas together and both work on the freedom project.

### How we Choose Our Tool and How I Planned to Tinkered with My Tool
Orginally, I thought of using <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-phaser-launcher"> Phaser</a> for my project, however Brianna also wanted to use <a href="https://kaboomjs.com/"> Kaboom</a>. Due to this, we agreed that we would seperately work on the tools we have orginally chosen. My goal for tinkering with Phaser was to create a short mini game using what I have taken notes on in my <strong> Learning.Log</strong>. I eventually found a <a href="https://github.com//phaserjs/editor-scripts-quick"> Github Phaser Editor Page</a> that contained pieces of code from the Phaser Editor that I could use that also gives a brief explanation of what the code does. which made it harder to me to start using the tool in my IDE. However, I was not able to fully tinker with these Phaser components because of the lack of time I had. I was also struggling with downloading Phaser into my IDE, which made it more difficult for me to get started with tinkering with my tool. 

### How I tinkered with Kaboom 
Since we have decided to go tinker with Kaboom, 


### EDP 
I am currently in Step 2 of the Engineering Design Process, which is to <strong> Research the Problem</strong>. I say this step because in order for me and my partner to be able to create our project, we would first have to understand what tool we are both going to use. Being that we decided to go with Kaboom, Brianna says that she knows some seniors that have also used Kaboom that could help us with understanding how to use this tool. 


### Skills I have Learned and Final Thoughts 
 From this experience, I learned that for the future of this project that I should work on my <strong> Time Management and Organization</strong>. I say this because despite not having the time to actually use Phaser myself, I still do feel like that there was more that I could of done with the time that I had. I would often focus more on my school work that I would forget about tinkering with Phaser. Keeping this in mind, I do feel better now that I will not be alone in learning a new tool this time.
