# Deciding on What to do for Project and Tools
##### 11/3/2025

### Where I am at Now
For my SEP11 Freedom Project, I am working with a classmate, Brianna, in order to create a Spanish Learner Platform Game. Before choosing to work with a partner on this project, I had an idea to make a platformer game that involved answering a trivia and based on how many questions you get right from the trivia, the rewards you get from the correct answers would help you advance in the game. Thats when I noticed that Brianna had a similar idea, where her idea was to have an education platformer game where it helps you learn spanish. So, we decided to combine our ideas together and both work on the freedom project.

### How we Choose Our Tool and How I Tinkered with My Tool
Orginally, I thought of using <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-phaser-launcher"> Phaser</a> for my project, however Brianna also wanted to use <a href="https://kaboomjs.com/"> Kaboom</a>. Due to this, we agreed that we would seperately work on the tools we have orginally chosen. My goal for tinkering with Phaser was to create a short mini game using what I have taken notes on in my <strong> Learning.Log</strong>. However, I never really had enough time to actually tinker and getting an understanding of Phaser, I was also often struggling with how to install Phaser and its editor.
